Typically, the CPA program can be completed within an 18-month timeframe.\r\nThe CPA Exam is composed of three types of assessments: multiple-choice questions (MCQs), task-based simulations (TBS), and written communication tasks. These examinations evaluate candidates on their knowledge, problem-solving skills, and communication abilities within the realm of accounting and finance.\r\n",
